# ALTAR-CHALLENGE

In this project I developed the client side with React and the server side with ExpressJs, both with Typescript.

To start working, you need to:


```
cd server

npm start
```
This will create a server running on port 3002 by default.

Then start the client:

on the root folder:
```
cd client

npm start
```
